Contributing
============

Ex-SML currently uses Git for source code management.

Submitting patches
------------------

  * Configure your Git author name and email address properly. Please see `man
    git-config` and look after `user.name` and `user.email`.

  * Use a clear commit message; explain your changes and make references to
    relevant websites, mailing lists, etc. where appropriate.

  * Use the `git format-patch` command to generate patches from your local
    repository. Please remember to add the `-M -C` options to `git
    format-patch` to catch copies and renames. This will eventually make the
    patch much easier to read. Remember to read `man git-format-patch`.

  * Please discuss your ideas in #ex-sml on the Freenode IRC
    network before you start working on them. This way we can clear out
    multiple work.
