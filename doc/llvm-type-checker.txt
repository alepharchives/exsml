* The LLVM Type checker

This is a description on how I think the type checker should work. I
am not sure that it is the right way to do it, but then I'll update
the document later on.

* Type checking

Type LLVM turns out to be straightforward, although their language is a
bit awkward. Whenever there is something which would require advanced tricks,
the system just punts and has a type designation.

Hence, you can type-check all of LLVM by *verification*. You always know
the supposed type of a statement or an expression and you just verify that
the given expression or statement has the right type. This is much simpler
since there is no reconstruction, no subtyping and no complexity.
