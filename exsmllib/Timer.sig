(* 
   [cpu_timer] is the type of timers for measuring CPU time consumption
   (user time, garbage collection time, and system time).

   [real_timer] is the type of timers for measuring the passing of
   real time (wall-clock time).

   [startCPUTimer ()] returns a cpu_timer started at the moment of
   the call.

   [totalCPUTimer ()] returns a cpu_timer started at the moment the 
   library was loaded.

   [checkCPUTime tmr] returns {usr, sys} where usr is the amount of
   user CPU time consumed since tmr was started and sys is the amount
   of system CPU time consumed since tmr was started.  Note that
   garbage collection time is included in the usr time.  Under MS DOS
   and MS Windows, usr time is measured as real time.

   [checkGCTime tmr] returns the amount of user CPU time spent on
   garbage collection since tmr was started.  Under MS DOS and MS
   Windows, gc time is measured in real time.

   [startRealTimer ()] returns a real_timer started at the moment of 
   the call.
   [totalRealTimer ()] returns a real_timer started at the moment the 
   library was loaded.

   [checkRealTime tmr] returns the amount of real time that has passed
   since tmr was started.
